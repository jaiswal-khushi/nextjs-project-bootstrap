# Bank Management System - Full Stack Java Web Application

## Overview
Build a web application with:
- Java backend using Spring Boot framework
- React frontend (plain React with TypeScript or JavaScript)
- REST API communication between frontend and backend
- Database for data persistence (H2/MySQL)

## Features
- Login page with authentication
- Transfer page for money transfer between accounts
- Report page showing customer details
- Balance page to check account balance
- Admin page to manage administrators

## Backend Plan
- Setup Spring Boot project with REST controllers
- Implement authentication API (login)
- Implement APIs for transfer, report, balance, admin management
- Use JPA/Hibernate for database interaction
- Use H2 or MySQL database
- Secure endpoints as needed

## Frontend Plan
- Setup React project
- Create pages/components for login, transfer, report, balance, admin
- Use fetch/axios to call backend APIs
- Implement forms and tables as per UI requirements
- Handle routing between pages

## Project Structure
- /backend - Spring Boot backend project
- /frontend - React frontend project

## Development Steps
1. Initialize backend Spring Boot project
2. Define entities and repositories
3. Implement REST controllers and services
4. Initialize React frontend project
5. Implement frontend pages and API integration
6. Test full system functionality

## Notes
- Implement code without comments as requested
- Use modern best practices for both backend and frontend
