# Self-Checkout App Plan

## Overview
Build a Flutter-based self-checkout app where customers scan product barcodes, view product details, manage a shopping cart with quantity and price calculations, and complete self-payment.

## Requirements
- Flutter SDK (version 3.0+)
- Mobile device with camera for barcode scanning
- No external API keys required (using mock data for products and payment simulation)

## Dependencies
- mobile_scanner: For barcode scanning
- provider: For state management
- flutter/material.dart: For UI components

## Project Structure
- lib/
  - models/
    - product.dart
    - cart_item.dart
  - providers/
    - cart_provider.dart
  - screens/
    - scanner_screen.dart
    - cart_screen.dart
    - payment_screen.dart
  - services/
    - product_service.dart
  - main.dart

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Flutter project structure
2. Create product and cart models
3. Implement product service with mock data
4. Build cart provider for state management
5. Create scanner screen with barcode detection
6. Implement cart screen with product list and totals
7. Build payment screen with simulation
8. Integrate navigation between screens
9. Test barcode scanning and cart functionality

## Features
- Barcode scanning using device camera
- Product lookup from mock database
- Automatic quantity increment for duplicate scans
- Real-time total price calculation
- Clean, intuitive UI for self-service
- Simulated payment process

## Testing
- Test barcode scanning with various product codes
- Verify cart calculations and quantity updates
- Ensure responsive UI on different screen sizes
- Test payment flow simulation
